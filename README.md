# toxic-comment-classification
The Kaggle competition for toxic comment classification about detection of different types of toxic comments by 
classifying them into one or more labels.

Data has a large number of Wikipedia comments which have been labeled by human raters for toxic behavior. The types of toxicity are:

1.toxic
2.severe_toxic
3.obscene
4.threat
5.insult
6.identity_hate
As it is a classification problem, I have designed a model which predicts a probability of each type of toxicity for each comment and resulted in good accuracy and made a complete report of the project.
